# Divinity 2 Skill Search
This is a minimalistic skill guide for Divinity Original Sin 2.

I got fed up with the process of wading through clunky menus and pages in order to look up skills. I decided to take matters into my own hands and solve this problem, by building my own thing. All you have to do is type your search criteria into a box and *bam,* things show up. When playing a game as tough as DOS:2, you want to have something that's easily accessible.

## **Format**

#### Users will be able to see:

- Skill category

#### Sample:

- **Aerotheurge**
- **Name:** *Favourable Wind*
- **Desc:** "Control the forces of nature so the wind is literally at your party's back. An aura increases you allies' movement speeds while they stay close to you. Sets Favourable Winds Aura for 4 turn(s)."
- **Cost:** 1 Memory slot
- **Cooldown:** 6 turns
- **Requirement:** Aerotheurge 1

- A search bar on the main page to quickly find skill info.

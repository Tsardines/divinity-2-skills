# Divinity 2 Skill Search
This is a minimalistic skill guide for Divinity Original Sin 2.

Searching skill information shouldn't be a pain, but it is. I've decided to build my own site where one can easily access this info. When playing a game as tough as DOS2, you want to have something that's easily accessible.

## **Format**

#### Users will be able to see:

- Skill category
- Skill name
- Description
- Skill cost
- Cooldown period
- Requirements

#### Sample:

- **Aerotheurge**
- **Name:** *Favourable Wind*
- **Desc:** "Control the forces of nature so the wind is literally at your party's back. An aura increases you allies' movement speeds while they stay close to you. Sets Favourable Winds Aura for 4 turn(s)."
- **Cost:** 1 Memory slot
- **Cooldown:** 6 turns
- **Requirement:** Aerotheurge 1

### **MVP**

- Main page that shows every skill
- A search bar on the main page to quickly find skill info.
- Separate pages that only show skills of those categories (i.e. Geomancer page)

### **Post-MVP**

- Color coding depending on the skill category (i.e. Pyrokinetic = red)
- Official skill icons

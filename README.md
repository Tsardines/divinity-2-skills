# Skill Checker
This is a minimalistic skill guide for Divinity Original Sin: 2.

I got fed up with wading through clunky menus and pages in order to look up skills. So I decided to make my own thing. All you have to do is type your search criteria into a box and *bam,* your info shows up. When playing a game as tough as DOS:2, you want to have knowledge that's easily accessible.

## **Format**

#### Users will be able to see:

#### Sample:

- **Aerotheurge**
- **Name:** *Favourable Wind*

- **Requires:** Aerotheurge 1

### **To Do**
- Convert main page into a two-column layout

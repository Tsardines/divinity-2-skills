# Skill Checker
This is a minimalistic skill guide for Divinity Original Sin: 2.

I became fed up with wading through clunky menus and pages in order to look up skills, and so I decided to build my own app to use. It's pretty simple: type your search criteria into a box and *bam,* things show up. When playing a game as tough as DOS:2, you want to have a skill guide that's easily accessible. **Skill Checker** is intended for personal use only and is not affiliated with Larian Studios.

## **Format**

#### Users will be able to see:

- A search bar on the main page to quickly find skill info.

# Skill Checker
This is a minimalistic skill guide for Divinity Original Sin: 2.

<<<<<<< HEAD
I got fed up with the process of wading through clunky menus and pages in order to look up skills. So I decided to make my own thing. All you have to do is type your search criteria into a box and *bam,* stuff shows up. When playing a game as tough as DOS:2, you want to have something that's easily accessible.
